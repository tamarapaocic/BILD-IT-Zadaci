Carrying himself with a proud, arrogant bearing, 
yet possessing a happy, sweet-natured temperament, 
the Shih Tzu is less demanding and less yappy than most other toy breeds.
Though he is solidly built and lively and loves to play in the yard, he doesn't need much more exercise than that. 
A lover of comfort and attention, he enjoys cuddling on laps and snuggling into soft pillows. 
He makes a terrific pet for senior citizens.
Most Shih Tzus are friendly (or at least polite) with strangers, 
though socialization is necessary to develop this trusting temperament. Shih Tzus are also peaceful with other pets.
Though he has an aristocratic demeanor, a stubborn streak, and definite likes and dislikes, 
the Shih Tzu doesn't tend to get into much trouble, and even when he doesn't obey very quickly, he's easy to forgive. 
Training will actually go very well if you rely on consistency, praise, and food rewards. 
The most difficult thing to teach a Shih Tzu is housebreaking.
